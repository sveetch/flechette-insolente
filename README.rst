Named after french version of `Dart Sass`_, this is a laboratory for research and
development on using Dart sass with its `Embedded Sass Protocol`_.

Dependencies
************

* `Python`_>=3.8;
* `Click`_>=8.0;

Goal
****

Embed a standalone version of dart-sass compiler into a Python package, such as it can
be installed from a project Python requirements without to install Dart or Node.

Study
*****

From `Node.js host <https://github.com/sass/embedded-host-node>`_ (which embed
dart-sass to be run from a Node.js library), i understood that:

* Package will need to include a compiled version of Dart sass (with its protocol
  enabled);
* There are multiple plateform builds for a compiled version;
* Seems the Node host build them during its release process or download it from
  https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases
* The compiled compiler have to be runned like an executable, we don't have something
  like a Python C module to manage or else;
* Once runned we dialog with compiler using the proctocol through STDIN commands and it
  will answer throught STDOUT, this is the only way to reach and instruct all compiler
  feature;
* Since dialog with protocol is normalized using
  Protocol buffers (see links section below), that is using a ``*.proto`` file to
  descript communication packets;


Protocol buffers links
**********************

* `Wikipedia definition <https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers>`_;
* `Protobuf library repository <https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf>`_;
* `Official package on Pypi <https://pypi.org/project/protobuf/>`_ (include precompiled
  protobuf);
* `Python tutorial <https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/pythontutorial/>`_;
* `Python API <https://googleapis.dev/python/protobuf/latest/>`_;
* `Generated code guide <https://protobuf.dev/reference/python/python-generated/>`_;
* `'.proto' file delivered by Sass<https://github.com/sass/sass/blob/main/spec/embedded_sass.proto>`_;


Plan
****

* Get the compiled compiler plateform version for my local system;
* Start a simple script to run the compiler;
* Try a basic way to dialog with compiler to compile a basic Sass source;
* When it's done, we can start to improve dialog to manage feature options and all;
* Look what Boussole will need to properly use this new compiler;
* Ensure everything is possible with Boussole;
* Stop this repository and start porting this science to Boussole to implement
  dart-sass support along libsass;
